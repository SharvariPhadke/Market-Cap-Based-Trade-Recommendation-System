# StockTalk

Overview of the project :
The trade recommendation system will suggest top performing stocks on the basis of their growth over the last two weeks to the users according to what market cap they are willing to invest into. The user will login to the system and select the market cap- large, mid or small in order to get the suggested stocks. When the user logs in again he/she will also be able to view the saved recommended stocks.

Project Objectives : 
The objective is to build an application which would recommend stocks on the basis of large, mid or small market cap.

Project Scope : 
This system is a trade recommendation software which recommends top performing stocks to the users. It is designed to help users identify the right stocks to invest into. On selection of required market cap, the software will fetch data from the YahooFinance API to take the top 5 performing stocks on the basis of their growth over the last two weeks and save it onto the database so that when the user logs in again he/she will be able to view it. A UI is provided to view the recommended stocks and the saved stocks.
